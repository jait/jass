                       jass - just another sudoku solver

What?

     * tries to solve 9x9 sudokus that don't require guessing and have a
       unique solution
     * should be able to solve most sudokus from newspapers

How?

     * uses logic only (no brute-force)
     * the following reduction techniques are implemented:

          * scans for singles
          * (hidden) singles in boxes, rows and cols
          * pointing pairs and triples (a.k.a. intersection removal)
          * box / line reduction (a.k.a. intersection removal)
          * naked pairs
	  * hidden pairs

Why?

     * just for fun
     * to see if I could create my own sudoku solver from scratch

Who?

     * Jari Tenhunen <jari.tenhunen@iki.fi>

TODO

     * more reduction techniques:

          * naked triples/quads
          * hidden triples/quads
	  * block / block interaction
	  * X-Wing

     * use a bit vector for storing candidates/possibles?
